                <h2 class="light-gray">About</h2>
                <p class="light-gray text">My name is Rolando Lopantzi, I am currently working towards being a design-oriented front-end developer. My mission is to build immersive and beautiful web applications through carefully crafted code and user-centric design. I grew up and currently live in Southern California, Orange County area to be more precise.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="light-gray text">My design journey started with me starting my career as a graphic designer, from there it was where I came across tasks in designing web layouts for potential website builds. I enjoyed the process of designing the look of what a website can look like but was not sure on how to make design become a live functioning site. I then took a few courses to learn to code and the struggle was real, at least for me it was. Lots of hours watching tutorials and trying to build an application. There were a lot of moments trying to figure out why something wasn't working and it was in those moments where I began to think about attending a school in order to be a self-sufficient developer.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="light-gray text">That's when I looked into joining a coding bootcamp to help me excel in my new coding journey that I am now pursuing. I decided to attend at the Coding Dojo of OC and currently still in the program. Definitely not easy, it's a really fast pace and challenging program but I'm still going strong.</p>
